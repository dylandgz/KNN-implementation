# KNN Classifier Implementation and Performance Evaluation

This repository contains code to evaluate a k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier implemented from scratch on the wine quality dataset. The evaluation employs various metrics and techniques.

## Part A: Model Code

The code defines functions for distance metrics (Euclidean and Manhattan) and evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score).

## Part B: Data Processing

Data preprocessing and exploration are performed, including feature selection and data partitioning.

## Part C: Model Evaluation

The implemented KNN classifier's performance is assessed using S-fold cross-validation, varying k values and distance metrics. Metrics include accuracy, generalization error, precision, recall, and F1 score. The repository also includes ROC curve, AUC score, precision-recall curve, and confidence interval calculations.

## Usage

Use this code to evaluate KNN classifier performance on the wine quality dataset. Customize parameters and integrate functions into projects.

## Conclusion

This repository offers a comprehensive toolkit to assess the self-implemented KNN classifier's performance, aiding parameter tuning and model selection.
